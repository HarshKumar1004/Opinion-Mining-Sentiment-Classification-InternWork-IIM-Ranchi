Data used in this project(roughly 50k+) was collected by performing Web Scraping on review platforms/websites like IMDb,  Amazon, Google Reviews etc.
Given a review, we had classified whether the review is of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. For reviews conveying both a positive and negative sentiment, whichever had the stronger sentiment was chosen.
